# Brand style guide: The Flusher

_The Flusher_ is the restroom newsletter for The Paladin Network. It mostly features upcoming campus
events and spotlighted articles for _The Paladin Newspaper_.

::: tip

Don't forget to capitalize "The" in _The Flusher_.

:::

Always include "The" in _The Flusher_. If it does not feel natural to include the "The", you need to
rephrase the sentence.

## The Royal Flush

_The Flusher_ was originally called _The Royal Flush_. This was avoid confusion with a different
publication of the same name operated by Univesity Communications that ceased publication in the
Spring of 2019. At the start of Fall 2022 semester, we renamed _The Royal Flush_ to _The Flusher_
because students, faculty, and staff were calling it _The Flusher_.

When referring to issues from before Fall 2022, refer to them as issues of _The Royal Flush_.
