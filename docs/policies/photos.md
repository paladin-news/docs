# Photo policy

In order to ensure we credit photographers correctly and do not use images to which we lack usage
rights, we have a strict photo crediting policy. We also want to ensure our photos appear well for
readers on all portions of our publications. Use the the tips on this page to ensure you only use
good photos – with permission – and credit photos correctly.

You and The Paladin may be held legally responsible for improper use of photos. Be careful when
using photos from the internet.

## Tips for good photos

Article cover photos may be automatically cropped. Follow these tips to ensure that people and text
are not cut off.

- Do not use portrait photos. Most photos are displayed in a 3:2 aspect ratio (the default for most
  cameras in landscape mode).
- Do not use blurry photos.
- Do not use photos where people's faces are close to the edge of the photo. Their heads may be cut
  off.
- Pick a photo that is relevant to your article. Avoid generic photos, which may be confusing to
  readers.
- Keep the focus of the photo in the center two-thirds of the photo. This ensures that photos can be
  safely automatically cropped.
- Avoid photos with lots of text. Never use screenshots of text.
  - Photos of signs or logos are appropriate, but the text must not be near the edges of the photos
  - As an alternative to screenshots of text, type it out in a block quote.

::: warning

**Screenshots of text are inherently inaccessible** because they cannot be read by readers who use
assistive technologies to read digital articles.

website.

Do not use a photo if you are not 100% sure we can legally use it. Familiarize yourself with the
different Creative Commons licenses.

## Appropriate crediting

In addition to ensuring you have permission to use a photo, you must also credit the photographer or
artist properly.

When you upload a photo to our CMS, you will have the option to provide photo credit. You only have
to do it once, and photo credit will be automatically displayed on subsequent uses of the photo.

Use the following guidelines to help credit appropriately:

### Guidelines

_Replace_ `Photographer` _with the photographer or artist's name._\
_Replace_ `Organization` _with the organization's acronnym or short name._

Staff photographers: `Photographer`/The Paladin\

Purchased photos: `Photographer`\
Free photos with permission: Courtesy of `Photographer`\
