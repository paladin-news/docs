## Constitution

The Board functions as a means of bringing student concerns to the attention of the faculty and
University authorities, of helping the University community formulate opinion on various campus and
off-campus issues, and of providing a forum for debate. The student communications media will
operate free of censorship.

Because Furman University may have to bear the legal responsibilities for the contents of the
publications, certain policies are considered inherent in the editorial freedom granted to student
editors and managers. These policies include, but are not limited to, the following:

### Article 1

<div class="article1">

1. The name of this organization shall be the Furman University Student Media Board, referred to
   below as the Board.
1. For the purposes of this constitution, the word “Editor” shall refer to the editors of the
   student newspaper, yearbook or literary publication and the managers for the television and radio
   stations or any future or successive organizations.
1. The Board shall be responsible to the Vice President for Student Life or his/her designee (Board
   Advisor) for the solvency of media and for their service to the college community as a whole.The
   Board Advisor shall be responsible for organizing and chairing Board meetings, advising on
   constitutional or policy matters, for monitoring and authorizing expenditures, for the
   maintenance of the liability insurance coverage for the Board (if any), and for the Board’s
   conformity to this constitution any and all University policies. The Board Advisor does not
   review or make any decisions on the content of the Board’s mass media.
1. The Board shall be composed of:
   1. The Vice President for Student Life or his/her designee (Board Advisor);
   1. One Editor of each organization; and
   1. The faculty/staff organizational advisor(s) for each media organization.
1. The authority of all Furman student media shall be vested in the Board, and shall extend to those
   media organizations recognized by the Board. Any publication that would be considered Furman
   student media must apply and be admitted to the Board to be produced and distributed on campus
   for the student body. Mass production of Furman student media through college facilities outside
   of the Board is subject to removal and may be required to cease publication. This rule, however,
   does not apply to media under the umbrella of other student organizations.
1. The Board shall be responsible for overseeing the individual media organizations that compose the
   Board, for acting as a liaison between the administration and the media organizations, for
   providing funding to the organizations, for reviewing unresolved complaints, for reviewing staff
   policy and procedures, for setting overall guidelines for the media organizations, for making
   capital equipment purchases, and for removing Editors who do not fulfill their responsibilities.
1. The Board shall meet at least once each semester during the academic year unless notified to the
   contrary by the Board Advisor. Special meetings may be called by the Board Advisor or by any two
   members of the Board.
1. If the scheduled meeting time of the Board is inconvenient for any Editor and no time can be
   found to accommodate all of the members of the Board, he/she may appoint a designee to serve as a
   voting representative in his/her place. The Board determines the competency of this designee and
   can, upon a majority vote, remove the designee from the Board, in which case the Editor must find
   a more suitable designee or begin to attend meetings himself/herself.
1. Each Editor on the Board shall have one vote, unless a member is acting as a designee for another
   member who has an excused absence for that particular meeting. No person may hold two positions
   on the Board simultaneously or have more than one vote. Media organizations coordinated by more
   than one editor will exercise one vote among them. The Board Advisor shall only vote to break a
   tie. Faculty/staff organizational advisors do not have votes but may take part in discussions.
1. The Board may invite other individuals to attend its meetings, but they may not vote. Except by
   invitation, Board meetings are closed.

   Advisor. Funding may also be removed from the publication for a period of time at the discretion
   of the Board. If a student member is being considered for removal from the Board, (s)he must
   receive a written notice of this matter prior to the next meeting. There is no recourse for
   actions taken by the Board. A three-quarters majority vote is required to remove any student
   member of the Board as well as to remove funding. All vacancies will be filled using the Editor
   Selection process outlined in this constitution.
1. Selection of new Editors occurs in the spring semester of the academic year. The selection is
   made by majority vote of the outgoing Editor (unless removed by the Board), the Board Advisor,
   and the faculty/staff organizational advisor.
1. In order to maintain editorial independence, organizations belonging to the Board are not
   eligible to receive funding from the Student Government Fee; instead, the Board receives set
   funds annually from Student Life’s operating budget to be used at the discretion of the Editor
   and in accordance with this constitution.
1. Funds from the Board may not be used to purchase equipment, services, or other property for a
   Furman office or department without notice to the Board of the planned purchase and approval by
   the Board Advisor.
1. Any alterations to organizational funds require a three-quarters majority vote.
1. Any publication or media production wishing to become recognized by the University must first
   apply to the Board. Applications for a new organization will be accepted according to the
   following guidelines:

   1. The proposed organization’s ability to provide a service or forum that existing organizations
      do not;
   1. An affirmative statement that the proposed organization will agree to include in all
      publications and/or broadcast a statement that the views and opinions are those of the authors
      and do not necessarily reflect the opinion of Furman University or its official
      representatives.

   one year. While on probation, the publication shall have a non-voting representative attend all
   Board meetings.

   :::

   ::: warning FALURE WHILE ON PROBATION

   Should a proposed organization fail to adhere to the above guidelines and/or fail to fulfill the
   details outlined in its proposal, upon a majority vote of the Board, probationary status shall be
   revoked, and the organization may only choose to request funding on a proposal basis with no
   preference over any other media organization.

   :::

   ::: tip OBTAINING PERMANENT STATUS

   After the organization has published and/or broadcast at least twice as a probationary
   organization, it may move to be considered a permanent media organization of Furman University.

   The organization will be admitted to the Board upon receiving approval of a majority of the
   voting members of the Board.

   Any organization already on permanent or probationary status shall receive preferential funding
   over newly proposed media organizations.

   :::

1. An organization belonging to the Board will be removed and considered inactive if no Editor is
   selected, no media of any discernable quality is produced, or no money is spent from its budget
   for two consecutive years. Removing an organization earlier for inactivity requires a
   three-quarters majority vote by the Board.
1. Alternations to this constitution require a three-quarters majority vote by the Board.
