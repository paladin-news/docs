Mobile advertisements will scale to be the width of the device, but they will be no larger than the
listed dimensions.

We recommend providing a high-resolution photo that will be scaled down. For example, provide
2400x400 for a 600x100 slot. This ensures your advertisement appears clear on high-resolution
screens.

We publish a new issue every 2-3 weeks during the academic semester. We typically print 1000 copies,
and newspapers are distributed into newsstands in the academic buildings, library, student center,
and dining hall.

Our schedule can be found at
[https://docs.thepaladin.news/print-newspaper/schedule](/print-newspaper/schedule).

The cost per column-inch decreases with size. Get a better bargain by placing a larger
advertisement. We can offer special pricing with a multi-issue commitment.

Frontpage ads have an additional $50 charge. Frontpage ads may not be larger than four inches tall.
Frontpage ads are typically placed near the bottom of the page. We do not differentiate between
above-the-fold and below-the-fold ads because we do not fold our newspapers in the newsstands.

We typically print in black and white. To print your ad in color, there is a flat rate of $250 per
issue – the cost of us printing in color.
