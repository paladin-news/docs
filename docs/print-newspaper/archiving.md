# Archiving print editions for the future

While most content in the print edition can be found on our website, the presentation is
significantly different. In addition, there is information in the print edition that might not be
available on the website.

For preservation of print editions for future generations, we provide physical print copies to
Special Collections & Archives and digital PDFs to the Digital Collections Center.

## Special Collections & Archives

Special Collections & Archives is a division that collections, organizes, and maintains physical
copies of publications and other items.

They can be found on the top floor of the main library. Be aware of their hours listed on their
section of the library website: https://libguides.furman.edu/special-collections/hours.

Deliver two or three physical copies of each issue to Special Collections reception
([location map](https://libguides.furman.edu/special-collections/visit/parking-and-location-maps))
following each release.

## Digital Collections Center

The Digital Collections Center preserves digital copies of items, including the print edition of
_The Paladin Newspaper_.

In the past, they have scanned and uploaded digital copies of the print editions. These copies do
not have accessible text search.

Now, we provide source PDF files, which are more accessible and legible that digital scans of print
copies.

Email PDF copies to digitalcollections@furman.edu.
