# Printing and shipping

The print edition of _The Paladin Newspaper_ is released nine times a year.

Our printer offers a rapid turnaround time, but we must follow the processes on this page to ensure
that we receive the print edition on time and without complication.

We print on short tabloid size paper (11.25 x 15 inches).

## Printer

We print via Mullen Publications.

For them to be able to offer a quick turnaround time, we must communicate our print schedule for the
academic year in advance. Our primary point-of-contact for Mullen Publications is Robert Mullen
(robert@mullenpublications.com), but their
[online contact](https://mullenpublications.com/contact-us/) form will also reach their staff.

::: info FACT

Mullen Publications uses Direct-to-Plate technology with recyclable paper and water-based ink. No
harmful chemicals!

## Prepress

::: danger

If you do not follow the prepress steps, there may be errors in the printing process.

:::

There are guidelines we must follow for the newspaper to print correctly. They are published by
Mullen Publications at https://mullenpublications.com/prepress/.

Steps of note:

- Use grayscale and CMYK for images. Colors may otherwise appear incorrectly.
- Use 200 ppi resolution.
- Preflight before generating the PDF file.
- Follow the PDF generation steps listed in the guidelines.

## Submitting for print

Do not spontaneously submit a newspaper for print. Coordinate with Mullen Publications so they are
aware of our print schedule.

Complete the [Print Submissions Form](https://mullenpublications.com/print-now/) two days before
distribution. For example, a Friday evening distribution should be submitted by Wednesday morning at
9 AM.

::: tip

**Ask for delivery one day before distribution in case there are delays in P2X.** We cannot pick up
deliveries until P2X processes the delivery. Keep in mind the hours of operation for P2X.

:::

Use your name and PMB number for P2X delivery. If you only use "The Paladin Newspaper" or "The
Paladin Network", the delivery will be lost or delayed. Most items delivered to "The Paladin
Newspaper" or "The Paladin Network" have never made it to our office.

::: warning

Remember to pick up the delivery from P2X before it closes.
